## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore the energy drink market and provide actionable recommendations to improve CodeX Energy Drink's market position. The key steps involved in the analysis are:

1. Data Import: Importing necessary Python libraries and loading data from three CSV files containing survey responses, respondent details, and city information.

2. Data Merging: Combining the data from the three CSV files using the pd.merge() function to create a consolidated DataFrame named 'df'.

3. Data Exploration: Exploring the 'df' DataFrame to understand its structure and identify potential insights.

4. Demographic Insights: Analyzing energy drink preferences across genders and age groups using bar charts.

5. Marketing Strategies: Evaluating the effectiveness of marketing channels, especially for the youth (15-30 age group), through bar charts.

6. Consumer Preferences: Understanding the preferred ingredients and packaging choices of respondents using bar charts.

7. Competition Analysis: Identifying current market leaders and reasons for their popularity over CodeX through bar charts.

8. Brand Awareness: Assessing how consumers perceive CodeX and identifying cities where brand awareness needs improvement using pie charts.

9. Purchase Behavior: Analyzing preferred purchase locations and typical consumption situations for energy drinks using pie charts.

10. Product Development: Identifying areas for product improvement (branding, taste, and availability) based on bar charts.

11. Data Export: Saving the final enriched dataset with insights and recommendations as 'Final_Data_CodeX.csv'.
